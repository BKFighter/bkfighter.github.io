<h2  style="width:80%;margin-left:10%;" class="important"><a class="bl-lnk" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> is a website aimed at ages 8-16 but available to all that encourages programming through simple pieces of blocks. That is where I have done most of my programming up to this point (end of 2015). If you would like to visit my profile (mostly games but also some simulators, and a few other projects), follow <a class="bl-lnk" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BKFighter/"> this</a> link.</h2>
